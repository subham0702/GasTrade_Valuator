# GasTrade_Valuator
The GasTrade Valuator is a prototype pricing model designed to provide accurate valuations of natural gas storage contracts. The project addresses the trading desk's need to assess contracts manually, with a focus on flexibility and precision. It enables the desk to consider key factors such as injection and withdrawal dates, commodity prices, storage costs, injection/withdrawal rates, and maximum storage capacity. This tool supports strategic decision-making by helping traders evaluate contracts based on anticipated seasonal price fluctuations in gas markets.
Problem Statement: The client anticipates a colder winter, likely leading to a rise in natural gas prices. To capitalize on this opportunity, the client aims to purchase and store gas now for future sales. The contract valuation must account for multiple cash flows, including purchase and sale prices, storage fees, injection/withdrawal costs, and volume constraints. A scalable and modular pricing model is essential for accurate contract evaluation, ensuring fairness for both the trading desk and the client.
Solution: The GasTrade Valuator is built on a framework integrating mathematical principles like sine-linear regression to account for seasonal price patterns. Sine-linear regression combines sinusoidal functions and linear trends to model cyclical price behaviors, which are common in energy markets due to seasonal demand shifts. By leveraging this approach, the pricing model estimates realistic price trajectories for gas purchase and sale over time.
The model processes multiple user inputs, including injection/withdrawal schedules, prices, and volumes, and calculates the net value of the contract. It achieves this by subtracting cumulative costs (storage fees, injection/withdrawal costs) from the revenue generated by selling stored gas at future prices. Designed for manual oversight, the prototype allows flexibility in exploring client scenarios. Ultimately, it forms a robust foundation for future automation, ensuring accurate and fair pricing in gas trading.
